  \caption{Closed-form prediction versus Sim4Life FDTD on the
  Thelonious phantom. Twelve directions and two polarizations per
  frequency from $0.45$--$5.8$~GHz; error bars show the spread
  across directions. The kernel curves switch on the corrections of
  \cref{subsec:corr-residuals} in sequence: ``Fresnel only'' uses
  $T_s/T_p$ at the convex limit, ``+ polarization'' adds the
  polarization-aware $\Teff$, ``+ curvature \& diffraction'' adds
  the $1/(kR)$ refinement, ``Full kernel'' is the constant-$T_0$
  geometric law without occlusion, ``Full + occlusion'' multiplies
  by $\Vis(\rr,\khat)$. The Cauchy stars are the closed-form
  whole-body identity, giving $1.012$ at $5.8$~GHz. The layered
  $\Tlay$ of \cref{subsec:fp} recovers the
  sub-$6$~GHz dip qualitatively.}
