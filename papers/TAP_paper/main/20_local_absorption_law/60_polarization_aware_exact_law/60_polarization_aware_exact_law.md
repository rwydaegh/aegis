A plane wave is fully polarized. At a surface point
$\rr$, decompose the incident electric field into local TE and TM
components by projecting on the unit vectors
$\hat{e}_s(\rr) = \khat \times \nhat / |\khat \times \nhat|$ and
$\hat{e}_p(\rr) = \hat{e}_s \times \khat$. Writing the field as
$\EE_0 = a_s \hat{e}_s + a_p \hat{e}_p$ and the local TE and TM
energy fractions as $|e_s|^2 = |a_s|^2 / |\EE_0|^2$ and
$|e_p|^2 = |a_p|^2 / |\EE_0|^2$, the effective transmission at $\rr$
is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Teff}
  \Teff(\rr) = |e_s(\rr)|^2 \, T_s(\theta) + |e_p(\rr)|^2 \,
  T_p(\theta)\, .
\end{equation}
The exact \gls{APD} at a visible point is therefore
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Sab-exact}
  \APD(\rr) = \IPD \, \Teff(\rr) \, \pospart{\mu(\rr)} \,.
\end{equation}
\Cref{eq:Sab-exact} holds for any polarization, any frequency where
the body is opaque, and any locally flat surface. The self-shadowing
factor $\Vis(\rr,\khat)$ of the geometric law in \cref{sec:pB} is
suppressed in this subsection because the Fresnel calculation
operates at a point already taken to be visible. Visibility re-enters
with the multi-source matrix form in \cref{subsec:matrix}.

% NEXT: # Polarization-aware exact law
To proceed, write
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Teff-decomp}
  \Teff(\rr) = \Tavg(\theta) + \tfrac{1}{2}\,q(\rr)\,\Delta T(\theta)\, ,
\end{equation}
with $\Tavg = \tfrac{1}{2}(T_s + T_p)$ the unpolarized baseline,
$\Delta T = T_p - T_s$ the polarization splitting, and $q = |e_p|^2 -
|e_s|^2 \in [-1, 1]$ the local TM excess. The polarization correction
vanishes pointwise for circular illumination, in expectation for
random-orientation linear illumination, and to within $2.5\%$ for
multipath averaging above 20 paths. First, for circular polarization
the TE and TM intensities are equal at every point on every body, so
$q \equiv 0$ pointwise. Second, for linear polarization with random
ensemble orientation either in space or time, the ensemble average
$\langle q\rangle$ vanishes by the same argument. Third, for a body
in a multipath environment with $N$ independent path orientations,
the variance of the polarization correction scales as $D_B/\sqrt{2N}$,
where $D_B \le 16\%$ is the body's polarization directivity on the
Thelonious phantom, and for $N \ge 20$ paths the correction drops
below $2.5\%$. Section~\ref{si:fresnel} of the SI derives all three
conditions and the $D_B/\sqrt{2N}$ variance bound. Under any of these conditions the exact law reduces to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Sab-Tavg}
  \APD(\rr) = \IPD \, \Tavg(\theta(\rr)) \, \pospart{\mu(\rr)}\, .
\end{equation}
The angular dependence is now confined to the scalar function
$\Tavg(\theta)$. The next section shows that this function is nearly
constant for biological tissue.
